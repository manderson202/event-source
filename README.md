# Event Source

Event Sourcing in Clojure

This is a **currently experimental** library that provides a Clojure implementation for the [Event Sourcing](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html) pattern. It provides a basic API for defining Aggregates, Commands, and Events and experimenting with the pattern.

Start with the [Getting Started](examples/src/getting_started.clj) example, which walks through setting up a contrived banking application to illustrate the properties of the system. Read through the namespace, load the file in your REPL, and start experimenting! (Note, the examples rely on Redis, which you can install and run locally).

From there, read through the [API](core/src/com/reifyhealth/event_source/core.clj)
